# FeedBoost

Ditch the delay in your [Reverb.com](https://reverb.com/) feed! FeedBoost is a simple web application built with the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) for the [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) platform that checks users' Reverb.com feeds every hour and sends notifications via email for every user whose feed has updated in the last hour.
